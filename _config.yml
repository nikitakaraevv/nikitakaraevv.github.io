# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
#
# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

#
# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

 I’m a founder of [Pixelwise AI](https://pixelwise.ai/), where we’re building technology to train robots using internet-scale human data. Previously, I was fortunate to do a PhD at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) and the [Visual Geometry Group, University of Oxford](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/), supervised by [Christian Rupprecht](https://chrirupp.github.io), [Natalia Neverova](https://nneverova.github.io), and
  [Andrea Vedaldi](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/). Before my PhD, I completed an engineering program at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) in beautiful Paris. I also enjoy running and exploring mountains 🏔️
